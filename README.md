Whoa, okay, so... It Feeds. Man, that was something else. It's like, I just, can't even fully process what just happened back there in that dark, overly air-conditioned theater. My knees are crunchy with, ya know, stale popcorn crumbs and my back kinda feels like it was attacked by a million tiny pillow fists. Still vibrating a bit from that entire experience. It's like if someone tried to blend reality and nightmares into a smoothie and then didn't give enough time to thicken up properly. Right, the  , uh, yeah, 777, so the scenes.

There was this part—I'm still not sure if it was a dream or if they really showed it—but a guy was yelling at a fishbowl, like seriously scolding it. And then the fish developed a really kind of worrisome manner, just floating there, looking ominous like it knew the secrets of the universe or who really ate the last slice of pizza. And the sound, ah man, it was like they left the mic on in the haunted fridge section of an electronics store—just a low, murmuring hum. Brilliantly unnerving.

The main character, oh what was his name? I think it was something completely out of left field, like Zebedee or Zebediah or one of those biblical epiphanies. He went on this tirade about the societal constructs of hunger, and I swear, it was like listening to a very passionate toast at a wedding where you only know the plus-one. Everything was spiraling and then boom—there was this chilling scene with a carousel. Carousel of dread, I’d call it. 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , yeah right, totally what someone wanted wasn’t it?

I think at one point, the audience collectively forgot how to breathe. Felt the lady next to me try to stifle a scream—or a sneeze, or maybe both. It's crazy how in those moments, someone's fear and your own just mix like that weird foam they always add to those fancy coffee orders you never understand. 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again, maybe? Not sure if my heart would agree, but the brain says yes.

And why, why, for all that is sane, was there a cactus singing opera? These things, man. They don't teach you about them in existential dread class.

Oh jeez, I have to—it's just laughable in a deeply, distressed way in the middle of this code.
